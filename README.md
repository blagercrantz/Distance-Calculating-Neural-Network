# Distance-Calculating-Neural-Network
In SwiftUI

A neural network that guesses the distance of a coordinate from the coordinate (0.5, 0.5). I just did it to learn about Neural Networks, the program itself is not useful at all of course.

It has 2 input neurons for x and y of the input coordinate, 4 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron that is (should be) the distance between the coordinates.
